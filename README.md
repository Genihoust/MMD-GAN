# MMD-GAN with Repulsive Loss Function
This repository contains codes for MMD-GAN and the repulsive loss proposed in the following paper:

Improving MMD-GAN Training with Repulsive Loss Function.  Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2019. URL: https://openreview.net/forum?id=HygjqjR9Km.

GAN: generative adversarial nets
MMD: maximum mean discrepancy

## Repository structure
The codes were written along with my learning of Python and GAN
